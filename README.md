## Features

- Calculate the final values for a circuit of 2 capacitors.
- model the final circuit showing the polarity.
- Can work on any pc with access to internet
  
## Installation

You need to install Pillow and requests library using both of the following commands in the terminal : 
 
  - PIL
  - requests
 
We advise to follow a tutuorial to help run code smoothly without any errors.
[Note : This step is very important for the code to work. Any error while installing will cause the program to not run!]

## usage
After completion of the installation, the user can run the code by any interpreter.
The user need to know the values of V1, V2, C1, C2, K1, K2 and the polarity of connection prior to the program.

## Screenshots

Testing a case where 
V1=30 V, V2= 20V , C1= 5 uf, C2=20uf , k1,k2 = 1 , poles connection are reversed initially :
