## Abstract 
"This  software system is able to.encrypt and decrypt a given message with Caesar cipher, Playfair cipher or
Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA) cipher. This program was written in C and only using Cstandard libraries. The design and ensuing program are modular in nature and make
maximum use of abstract data types and of software reuse. Particular attention must
be paid to RSA cipher for being “plain RSA”, in other words it’s a pure implementation
of the basic RSA algorithm. So please don’t use it for anything other than educational
purposes."

## Features

-Encryption and decryption using RSA , playfair and
caesar algorithms.

-Ability to import and export files in the RSA
algorithm.

-Ability to generate p & q in RSA either manually or
by entering a password.

-Ability to encrypt and decrypt in Caesar Cipher with
positive or negative numbered keys and values from- 2147483647 to 2147483647[-2*10^9 ,2*10^9].

-Ability for the user to enter spaces in keys and
plaintexts in Playfair cipher.

  
## Installation

You just have to run the code through a compiler supporting C.

## usage
At first, the user should choose the needed
algorithm (RSA , Caesar , Playfair ).

○ The user can either encrypt or decrypt in any
algorithm.

○ In RSA, you get to choose whether to encrypt or
decrypt by entering p, q manually or entering a
password . (Note: the password generates p, q
randomly whilst entering p,q manually you must
consider both need to be prime. An error message
appears if entered p,q aren’t prime or equal to each
other ).
